Income Prediction Model (ML)

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K using demographic and work-related features from the Adult Census dataset.

📊 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook / Anaconda

Adult Census Income Dataset

Machine Learning Models (SVM, Decision Tree, KNN)

🔍 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Encode categorical features and normalize numerical features

Train and compare ML classifiers (SVM, DT, KNN)

Evaluate results using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports

Identify the most effective model for income classification

🧠 Key Insights

SVM achieved the highest performance (~85% accuracy)

Decision Tree & KNN performed slightly lower (~84% accuracy)

Feature scaling and encoding significantly improved model results

Income classification is strongly influenced by education level, occupation, and hours worked per week

🚀 Summary

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to classify income levels using demographic data.
It showcases preprocessing techniques, ML model comparison, and clear evaluation of performance metrics — making it a strong portfolio piece for data & ML roles.
